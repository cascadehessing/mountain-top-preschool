			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>To me, in home preschool looks like kids who learn through 
				having fun. Kids can learn and grow before they get into 
				kindergarten so they can have a greater success rate at 
				excelling more academically. I want to help kids become better 
				everyday and learn important life skills.</p>
