        <p class="about">After seven years of teaching in private schools, 
            the next chapter led to an exciting new settingâ€”an in-home 
            preschool. Mountain Top In-Home Preschool was established in 
            2022 and is brimming with potential for an inspiring future. 
            We take immense joy in welcoming children into our home and 
            watching them develop a love for learning. The kids delight 
            in playing games, exploring the outdoors, and engaging in 
            hands-on activities. We also cherish moments when they are 
            fully immersed in storytime or focused during work activities, 
            fostering their growth in every way.
