        <p class="about">After seven years of private school teaching, the next chapeters setting relocated to an in home preschool.
            Mounatin Top in home preschool was established in 2022, with an exciting future ahead of us all.
            We love to have kids in our home and watch them as they grow to love learning. The kids enjoy playing
            games and being outside, they are also happy to use their hands when it comes to hands-on activities,
            but we also love to watch them as they are focused on listening during reading time and during work time.
